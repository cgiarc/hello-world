JK! That's just an image I found on the internet! I'm really a boy with access to a computer and an obsession with rhinoceroses.

Here is another <span>Photo from <a href="https://unsplash.com/@redcharlie?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">redcharlie</a> on <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/rhino?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText">Unsplash</a></span>.

Did you know that there are [5 types of rhinoceros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros)?
1.	White rhinoceros
2.	Black rhinoceros
3.	Indian rhinoceros (image at the top)
4.	Javan rhinoceros
5.	Sumatran rhinoceros

They all look slightly different and live in different parts of the world.

Thanks for reading. *Bye!*
