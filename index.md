Hi my name is **Tim** and this is my website.

Here is a picture of me.

JK! That's just an image I found on the internet! I'm really a boy with access to a computer and an obsession with rhinoceroses.


Did you know that there are [5 types of rhinoceros](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhinoceros)?
1.	White rhinoceros
2.	Black rhinoceros
3.	Indian rhinoceros (image at the top)
4.	Javan rhinoceros
5.	Sumatran rhinoceros

They all look slightly different and live in different parts of the world.
